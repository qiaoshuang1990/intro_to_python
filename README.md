# UCSD IDEA: Intro to Python
Files for the Intro to Python workshops, presented by the IDEA Student Center of UC San Diego.

## Requirements
- python 2.x or 3.x
- jupyter notebook (formerly known as ipython-notebook)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
We *highly* recommend installing Python and related scientific packages using Anaconda, a free Python distribution created by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/) that is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. To install:

1. go to the Anaconda download page: [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)
2. download the Python **3.x** installer for your OS
3. run the installer


## Trying the code out (online)
If you're having trouble installing or running Python locally, you can alternative using the [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) hosting service by clicking here: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/ucsdidea/intro_to_python)

**NOTE** The Binder service is free, but it is a temporary fix.
